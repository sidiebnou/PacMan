# PacMan
With this code we showcases a carefully designed implementation for controlling the movement of a PacMan image on a webpage. It manages the image's position, direction, and appearance effectively, delivering an engaging user experience. By utilizing a selection of movement images, PacMan smoothly moves across the webpage, and run around back and forth
PacMan goes around left and right. As it gets to the edge it switches to the opposite direction.

Future Improvements:

    -We can add more funtionality to the page and add mmore styling using CSS.
